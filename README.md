# HeX - Game written with LibGDX
HeX is a game that has similaritys with the boardgame "risk" but is based on a hexagonal
grid. Another concept is that it isn't turn based, although it could be classified as a board game. Reason for that is
the curiosity to learn whether it can be an improvement for a board game to play it time based instead of turn based.

Since it's in an very early stage of development please don't expect anything from it yet.
